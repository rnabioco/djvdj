\usage{
import_vdj(
  input = NULL,
  vdj_dir = NULL,
  prefix = "",
  data_cols = NULL,
  filter_chains = TRUE,
  filter_paired = FALSE,
  define_clonotypes = NULL,
  include_mutations = FALSE,
  aggr_dir = NULL,
  sep = ";"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Object containing single cell data, if set to NULL a data.frame
containing V(D)J results will be returned}

\item{vdj_dir}{Directory containing the output from cellranger vdj. A vector
or named vector can be given to load data from multiple runs. If a named
vector is given, the cell barcodes will be prefixed with the provided names.
This mimics the behavior of Seurat::Read10X().}

\item{prefix}{Prefix to add to new columns}

\item{data_cols}{Additional columns from filtered_contig_annotations.csv to
include in object.}

\item{filter_chains}{Only include chains with at least one productive and
full length contig.}

\item{filter_paired}{Only include clonotypes with paired chains. For TCR
data each clonotype must have at least one TRA and TRB chain, for BCR data
each clonotype must have at least one IGH chain and at least one IGK or IGL
chain.}

\item{define_clonotypes}{Define clonotype IDs based on V(D)J data. This is
useful if the V(D)J datasets being loaded do not have consistent clonotype
IDs, i.e., clonotype1 is not the same across samples. Possible values are:
\itemize{
\item 'cdr3aa', define clonotypes based on the CDR3 amino acid sequence
\item 'cdr3nt', define clonotypes based on the CDR3 nucleotide sequence
\item 'cdr3_gene', define clonotypes based on the combination of the CDR3
nucleotide sequence and the V(D)J genes.
}

When defining clonotypes, only productive full length chains will be used.
Set to NULL (default) to use the clonotype IDs already present in the input
data.}

\item{include_mutations}{Include information about the number of
insertions/deletions/mismatches for each chain. This requires the
concat_ref.bam file from cellranger vdj to be present the directory provided
to vdj_dir. If include_mutations is TRUE, filter_chains is also
automatically set TRUE since indel data is only available for productive
chains.}

\item{aggr_dir}{Path to cellranger aggr output. To include mutation
information for each chain, also provide paths to the original cellranger
vdj output directories using the vdj_dir argument.

To correctly match cell barcodes to those in the object, gene expression
data for each sample must be loaded in the same order as the samples were
specified in the cellranger aggr config file. In addition, if loading
mutation data, sample paths provided to the vdj_dir argument must also be in
the same order as the samples were specified in the cellranger aggr config
file.}

\item{sep}{Separator to use for storing per cell V(D)J data}
}
\value{
Single cell object or data.frame with added V(D)J data
}
