The djvdj package provides a range of tools to analyze and manipulate single cell V(D)J sequencing data. These tools are straightforward and easily integrate into a standard [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) workflow. This is a work in progress, please report any bugs by opening a new issue.

## Installation

You can install the development version of djvdj from [GitHub](https://github.com/rnabioco/djvdj) with:

```r
devtools::install_github("rnabioco/djvdj")
```

## Import

With djvdj you can import V(D)J sequencing results from [Cell Ranger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/software/pipelines/latest/using/vdj#header) and add these data to a [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) or [SingleCellExperiment](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html) object using `import_vdj()`. Additional functions are provided to filter and modify (`filter_vdj()`, `mutate_vdj()`, `summarize_vdj()`) the object based on V(D)J metrics including chains, clonotypes, and CDR3 sequences.

```{r}
library(djvdj)

# Import VDJ data
# A vector of paths can be provided to load multiple datasets
# If prefixes were added to the cell barcodes when the object was generated,
# include these as the vector names
vdj_dirs <- c(
  BL6 = system.file("extdata/splen/BL6_BCR", package = "djvdj"),
  MD4 = system.file("extdata/splen/MD4_BCR", package = "djvdj")
)

# Add V(D)J data to object
so <- import_vdj(splen_so, vdj_dir = vdj_dirs)
```

## Calculate

djvdj allows you to calculate a range of population diversity and similarity metrics implemented with the [abdiv](https://github.com/kylebittinger/abdiv) package. The function `calc_diversity()` can be used to measure diversity on a per-cluster or per-sample basis to allow for comparison across conditions. `calc_similarity()` will measure repertoire overlap between clusters or samples to allow for direct comparisons between cells of interest. Additional functions are also available to calculate clonotype abundances and V(D)J gene usage (`calc_frequency()`, `calc_gene_usage()`).

```{r}
so <- calc_diversity(
  input       = so,              # Seurat object
  data_col    = "clonotype_id",  # Column containing clonotypes
  cluster_col = "orig.ident",    # Column containing cell clusters to compare
  method      = abdiv::simpson   # Diversity metric to use
)
```

## Plot

For each 'calc' function, djvdj also provides a corresponding 'plot' function to summarize the results.

```{r "usage", fig.width = 14, fig.height = 3}
# Compare the usage of different V and J genes
plot_gene_usage(
  input       = so,                     # Seurat object
  data_cols   = c("v_gene", "j_gene"),  # Column(s) containing V(D)J genes to plot
  cluster_col = "orig.ident",           # Column containing cell clusters to compare
  chain       = "IGK",                  # Chain to plot
  plot_colors = "#6A51A3"
)
```
